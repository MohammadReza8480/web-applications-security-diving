# web-applications-security-diving
This repository contains fully vulnerable, AI-written, and secure web applications written in various programming languages, including PHP, Python, and Node.js. The purpose of this repository is to provide a resource for secure code review and penetration testing.

The AI-written applications are completely written using Google Bard, The vulnerable applications are based on the same AI-written but designed to be fully vulnerable. The secure applications are written using secure coding practices to prevent security vulnerabilities of the vulnerable applications from occurring in the first place.

- Hone your penetration testing skills by exploiting vulnerabilities in the "Vulnerable" versions.
- Understand the impact of AI in application security by analyzing the "AI-written" versions.
- Learn and implement secure coding practices by studying the "Secure" versions.
- Benchmark your skills and track your progress as you navigate through the different versions.
